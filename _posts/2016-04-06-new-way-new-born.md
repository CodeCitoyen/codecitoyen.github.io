* A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.

Friends can help each other. A true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself - and especially to feel. Or, not feel. Whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine with them. That's what real love amounts to - letting a person be what he really is.

Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Eos, mollitia!
